# ðŸ“Š Use Agents to Analyze Data Ingested into RisingWave

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to implement a custom Anthropic agent and integrate it with RisingWave MCP to perform simple stream processing tasks on live data.

For a reference implementation, check out [this repository](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/awesome-stream-processing/).

---

## Prerequisites

- Install and run **RisingWave**. See the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.risingwave.com/get-started/quickstart/).
- Acquire an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
- Ensure `psql` (PostgreSQL interactive terminal) is installed. [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
- Clone [RisingWave MCP](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-mcp.git).

---

## Setup

### Install Dependencies  
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
```bash
pip install anthropic fastmcp python-dotenv tabulate
```
### Create .env File
Create a .env file in your project directory with:
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>
RISINGWAVE_HOST=0.0.0.0
RISINGWAVE_USER=root
RISINGWAVE_PASSWORD=root
RISINGWAVE_PORT=4566
RISINGWAVE_DATABASE=dev
RISINGWAVE_SSLMODE=disable
RISINGWAVE_TIMEOUT=30
```
### Generate Test Data in RisingWave
Use this command inside psql to set up a streaming data table:
```psql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id int,
  risk int,
  cost int,
  time timestamp
)
WITH (
  connector = 'datagen',
  fields.id.length = '1',
  fields.id.kind = 'sequence',
  fields.id.start = '1000',
  fields.risk.length = '1',
  fields.risk.kind = 'random',
  fields.risk.min = '0',
  fields.risk.max = '10',
  fields.risk.seed = '5',
  fields.cost.length = '1',
  fields.cost.kind = 'random',
  fields.cost.min = '1',
  fields.cost.max = '10000',
  fields.cost.seed = '8',
  fields.time.kind = 'random',
  fields.time.max_past = '5h',
  fields.time.max_past_mode = 'relative',
  datagen.rows.per.second = '10'
)
FORMAT PLAIN ENCODE JSON;
```
Running the Agent

Start your agent by running:

python client.py risingwave-mcp/src/main.py
Example Queries

Here are some example queries you can run once the agent is active:

Get Database Version
```bash
I'll help you check the RisingWave database version using the `get_database_version` function.
[Calling tool get_database_version with args {}]
Based on the output, you're using:
- RisingWave version 2.2.0
- It's built on PostgreSQL 13.14.0
- This appears to be the Homebrew installation version
```

List all tables

```bash
I'll help you list all the tables in the database using the `show_tables` function.
[Calling tool show_tables with args {}]
Here are all the tables in the database:
1. users
2. _risingwave_py_version (this appears to be a system table)


Let me get more details about the 'users' table since that's likely the main table you're interested in.
[Calling tool describe_table with args {'table_name': 'users'}]
Let me break down the structure of the 'users' table:

Main Columns:
1. id (integer)
2. risk (integer)
3. cost (integer)
4. time (timestamp without time zone)

System Columns:
5. _row_id (serial) - Primary Key
6. _rw_timestamp (timestamp with time zone)

Additional Information:
- Primary Key: _row_id
- Distribution Key: _row_id
- Table Name: users

This appears to be a table tracking user information with their associated risk, cost, and timestamp data.


Let me know if you'd like to:
1. See the actual data in this table
2. Get row count statistics
3. Or perform any other operations on this table
```

Show me data from the users table

```bash
I'll help you see the data from the users table using the run_select_query function.
[Calling tool run_select_query with args {'query': 'SELECT id, risk, cost, time FROM users;'}]
The users table contains 31,768 rows with 4 columns. Here's a breakdown:

First 5 rows:
1. ID: 21970, Risk: 2, Cost: 9594, Time: 2025-06-27 13:39:00
2. ID: 21971, Risk: 10, Cost: 6808, Time: 2025-06-27 13:38:28
3. ID: 21972, Risk: 8, Cost: 8763, Time: 2025-06-27 13:19:21
4. ID: 21973, Risk: 5, Cost: 6721, Time: 2025-06-27 13:26:52
5. ID: 21974, Risk: 5, Cost: 7152, Time: 2025-06-27 11:20:54

Last 5 rows:
1. ID: 21828, Risk: 0, Cost: 697, Time: 2025-06-27 15:22:02
2. ID: 21860, Risk: 10, Cost: 915, Time: 2025-06-27 15:16:05
3. ID: 21892, Risk: 1, Cost: 7698, Time: 2025-06-27 10:42:33
4. ID: 21924, Risk: 5, Cost: 9479, Time: 2025-06-27 14:04:30
5. ID: 21956, Risk: 0, Cost: 6663, Time: 2025-06-27 14:52:16

Column details:
- id: Unique identifier for each user
- risk: Risk score (ranges from 0 to 10)
- cost: Transaction cost (ranges from 697 to 9594)
- time: Timestamp of the transaction (all on June 27, 2025)
```

Describe the users table

```bash
Table Properties:
- Primary Key: _row_id
- Distribution Key: _row_id
- Table Name: users

The table appears to be designed to track user-related data with associated risk scores, costs, and timestamps.


Each row in the table has:
- A user ID
- A risk value (as an integer)
- A cost value (as an integer)
- A timestamp for when the record was created/updated
- System-managed columns for internal use (_row_id and _rw_timestamp)
```

Track the highest risk scores in users

```bash
I'll help you create a materialized view to track the highest risk scores from the users table. This will continuously maintain the maximum risk scores as new data comes in.
[Calling tool create_materialized_view with args {'name': 'highest_risks', 'sql_statement': 'SELECT id, risk, time \nFROM users \nWHERE risk = (SELECT MAX(risk) FROM users)'}]
Great! The materialized view 'highest_risks' has been created successfully. You can now query this view to see the highest risk scores from the users table. The view will maintain an up-to-date list of the highest risk values, making it efficient to monitor high-risk cases.
```

Display the top rows of that materialized view

```bash

I'll query the materialized view 'risk_by_spending' to show the top rows:
[Calling tool run_select_query with args {'query': 'SELECT * FROM risk_by_spending LIMIT 10;'}]
Looking at the materialized view data, here's a summary of the highest total costs:

1. Risk Level 4: $14,777,992 (highest total cost)
2. Risk Level 8: $14,661,035
3. Risk Level 7: $14,565,086
4. Risk Level 9: $14,547,682
5. Risk Level 10: $14,550,576

Some interesting observations:
- Risk Level 4 has the highest total cost despite not having the highest count
- Risk Level 5 has the highest average cost per transaction (about $5,045)
- The counts range from 2,823 to 2,952 transactions across risk levels
- All risk levels (0-10) show similar patterns in terms of total costs, suggesting relatively even distribution

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of this data in more detail?
```

Once you are done just query 'quit' to exit the program.
